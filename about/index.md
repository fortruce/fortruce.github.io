# About Me

<br/>

Hello! My name is Joseph Rollins, and I am a software developer.
I love developing applications that engage and enable people to achieve their goals.

When I'm not working, I enjoy checking out new frameworks and technologies. The
web is constantly evolving, and I like to learn. Just because something is new
doesn't mean it is better, but I like to spend some time in the weeds myself. There
is always something to take away.

Sometimes I need a break from the computer though. In those times I enjoy biking,
running, cooking, and drinking coffee.
