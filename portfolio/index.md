## [Bike In DC](http://bikeindc.com)

Bike In DC is an application that enables Capital Bikeshare users around DC to
quickly find nearby Bikeshare stations. The official app is too cluttered, and I
easily got frustrated trying to navigate something that should be simple.

The application utilizes Google Maps and Capital Bikeshare APIs to find the closest
Bikeshare stations and keep you updated on how many bikes and open slots they have.

Bike In DC even enables you to search for stations around a given address or place. This way
you can search for the status of stations near the restaurant you're headed to and
ensure there is a spot nearby to park!

## .Code()

This very blog was built up from scratch relying on as few dependencies as possible.
All of the design and layout was done manually without the help of any framework
as a way to practice my CSS and responsive design.
